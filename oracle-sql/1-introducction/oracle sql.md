## Oracle SQL

_Structured Query Language_ (`SQL`) is the set of statements with which all programs and users access data in an Oracle Database.

Application programs and Oracle tools often allow users access to the database without using SQL directly, but these applications in turn must use SQL when executing the user's request.
