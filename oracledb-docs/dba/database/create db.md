# Using DBCA to create and configure a Database

During installation, you can direct the installer to create and configure a new database.

However, if you install Oracle software only, or if you want to create additional databases with the release software that you just installed, then you can use the Database Configuration Assistant (DBCA).

DBCA enables you to perform the following tasks:

- Creating a Database with DBCA
- Configuring Database Options with DBCA
- Deleting a Database with DBCA
- Managing Templates with DBCA
- Configuring Automatic Storage Management with DBCA

## Starting DBCA

To launch _DBCA_ on a Windows operating system, click Start and then select Programs, Oracle - _home_name_, Configuration and Migration Tools, and then Database Configuration Assistant.

To launch the _DBCA_ on _UNIX_, or as another method on a Windows operating system, enter the following command at a system prompt:

```
dbca
```

The _dbca_ utility is typically located in _ORACLE_HOME/bin_.

## Creating a Database with DBCA

On the DBCA Operations window, select Create a Database to start a wizard that enables you to create and configure a database.

The wizard requests your input on the following:

### Database Templates

### Database Identification

### Management Options

### Database Credentials

### Storage Options

### Database File Locations

### Recovery Configuration

### Database Content

### Initialization Parameters

### Database Storage

### Database Creation Options
