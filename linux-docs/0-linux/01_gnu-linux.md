# GNU/Linux

_GNU/Linux_ is a term used to describe operating systems that integrate the Linux kernel with GNU software.

Although we commonly refer to the operating system as _"Linux"_, the term _Linux_ actually refers only to the _kernel_, which by itself lacks the interfaces needed to interact with the system. To form a complete operating system, the Linux kernel is combined with GNU utilities.

### GNU Project

- launched in 1983 by Richard Stallman
- goal of developing a completely free and open-source operating system.
- provides the core components that are critical for an operating system, including compilers, libraries, text editors, and shell programs

### Linux Kernel

- created by Linus Torvalds in 1991
- core part of an operating system
- manages the system’s hardware, runs processes, and handles memory, among other tasks.
- does not provide the user tools or interfaces needed to interact with the system—this is where the GNU tools come in.

## Open Source

Linux is released under the GNU General Public License (`GPL`), which means that anyone is free to run, study, share, and modify the software. Modified code can also be redistributed and even sold, but it must be done under the same license.

This is a significant difference from traditional operating systems like Unix and Windows, which are proprietary, cannot be modified.
