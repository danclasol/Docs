# `su`

The `su` command stands for _substitute user_ or _switch user_.

It allows you to switch from the current user account to another user account. It’s commonly used to switch to the root user for administrative tasks.

## Difference with `sudo`

The command `sudo` executes a command as another user (usually root) after authenticating with the current user's password.

It’s more granular than `su` and allows specific command permissions without needing to know the target user's password.

## Common Use

### Switch to root user

This command switches the current user to the root user. You will be prompted to enter the root user's password.

```sh
su
```

### Switch to another user

Replace username with the target user's name. You will be prompted to enter that user's password.

```sh
su username
```

### Switch to another user with a specific shell

The `-` (or `-l` or `--login`) option simulates a full login, which means that you get the environment and login scripts of the target user as if you had logged in directly as that user. This includes setting environment variables and changing to that user's home directory.

```sh
su - username
```

### Run a command as another user

Replace command with the command you want to execute. This will run the specified command as the target user.

```sh
su -c 'command' username
```
