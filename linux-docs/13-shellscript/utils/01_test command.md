# Test

The `test` command in a Linux shell script is used to evaluate conditional expressions.

It allows you to perform comparisons and tests on strings, numbers, and files, and returns a status code that can be used in if statements or other conditional constructs.

Using the test command explicitly:

```sh
test condition
```

Using square brackets (which is a synonym for test)

```sh
[ condition ]
```
