Permissions can be represented in two ways:

- **Symbolic Mode**: Using letters (e.g., r, w, x).
- **Numeric Mode (Octal)**: Using numbers (e.g., 7, 6, 5, 4).

There are four parts to a file's permissions.

d | rwx | rwx | r-x
```

- The first character indicates the file type
  - `-` for a regular file,
