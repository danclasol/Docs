## `.` (Repeat Last Change)

Repeat the last change you made in Normal mode. This is incredibly useful for applying the same edit multiple times without retyping the command.

## `~` (Toggle Case)

Toggles the case of the character under the cursor (lowercase to uppercase and vice versa).

## `u` (Undo)

The u command undoes the last change you made.

## `Ctrl` + `r` (Redo)

The `Ctrl` + `r` command redoes a change that was undone with `u`.
