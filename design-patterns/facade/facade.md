# Facade

Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified
interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set
of classes.

## Benefits

- Easier to use complex systems
- Reduce the dependencies to other subsystems

## When to use

- For complex system with several modules and we need an straitforward interface to communicate between them
- When the code is coupled due to the fact that clients need a strong knowledge of the system
- A system that needs an input for each software layer
