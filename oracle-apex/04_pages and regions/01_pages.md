# Page

A Page is a basic building block of an application.

Each page in an Oracle APEX application contains one or more regions. Regions function as containers for content. A region can contain static HTML, or it can be a report based on a SQL query. A region can contain items, buttons, and a navigation menu.

Now, an item is a part of an HTML form. An item can be a text field, text area, password, select list, checkbox, and so on. You can use buttons to direct users to a specific page or URL or to post or process information. For example, cancel, delete, apply changes, and so on.
