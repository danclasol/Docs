# Modern Java Versions

Since Java 10 (2018) two new Java version are release each year, one in March and one in September.

### Time-driven release model

Java no longer waits for large, bundled updates regardless of feature readiness.

- every 6 months, a new version is released, regardless of feature readiness
- avoid delays caused by waiting for big features
- new features (even small ones) can be delivered quickly and incrementally
- features can be introduced as previews and improved based on communuty feedback before becoming final

### LTS and non-LTS versions

Not every version is a Long-Term Support (LTS) version

- non-LTS releases are supported for only 6 months
- LTS versions get years of support
