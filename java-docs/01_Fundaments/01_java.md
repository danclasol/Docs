# Java

Java is a high-level language developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1990s (now owned by Oracle).

It is widely used for building cross-platform applications, from mobile apps to large-scale enterprise systems.

## Features

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

  - based on classes and objects, promoting modularity and code reusability

- Strong typing:

  - every variable must be declared with a specific data type, and the type of data assigned to it must be compatible
  - this helps prevent errors at runtime by catching mismatches at compile time

- Statically typed:

  - type checking is done at compile time rather than at runtime
  - this enhances performance and reliability

- Automatic Memory Management:

  - uses a garbage collector to automatically manage memory, freeing up resources that are no longer in use

- Robust and Secure:

  - early error checking
  - exception handling
  - runtime security features

- Multithreading Support:

  - multiple tasks simultaneously
  - improving performance for certain types of applications

- Rich Standard Library:

  - Java comes with an extensive set of built-in libraries that simplify many programming tasks

- Platform independence:
  - Java Virtual Machine (JVM) compile Java code into bytecode, which can run on any device that has a JVM, making Java applications truly "write once, run anywhere."
