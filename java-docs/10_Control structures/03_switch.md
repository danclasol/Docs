# Switch

In Java, the switch statement is used to execute one out of many code blocks based on the value of a variable or expression. It's often more efficient and readable when you have multiple conditions that depend on the same variable.

```java
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // Code block for value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // Code block for value2
        break;
    // More cases as needed
    default:
        // Code block if none of the cases match
}
```
