# Object-Oriented Programming

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which are instances of classes.

Java is designed around this paradigm, where everything is centered around creating and managing objects.

## Features

- Abstraction
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance

## Encapsulation

Hide internal details of a class and expose only the necessary attributes or methods

- increases code safety and maintainability

In Java, the access to members of a class can be control using with access modificators:

- private
- protected
- public

## Abstraction

Focusing on the essential characteristics and hiding unnecessary details.

- focus on what an object does instead of how it does it
- decouples logic, implementation can change without affecting users
- reduce complexity
- improves maintainability
- encourages interface-based programming

## Inheritance

A class can inherit attributes and methods from another (extends keyword).

- reuse code from parent classes
- extensibility, add or modify behavior in subclasses
- hierarchy structure, organizing related classes

## Polymorphism

The ability for a class to behave differently depending on the context.

- makes code flexible and extensible
- same method name can be used for different object types
- encourages interface-based programming
