# Variables

Variables are containers that can hold different values during the execution of a program.

### Syntax

```java
type name = value;
```

### Example

```java
int age = 25;
String name = "Alice";
boolean isActive = true;
int, String, boolean are data types.

age, name, isActive are variable names.
```

You can change the value later

```java
age = 30;
name = "Bob";
```
