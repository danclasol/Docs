# Spring boot

Spring Boot helps you to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications that you can run.

- Provide a radically faster and widely accessible getting-started experience for all Spring development

- Be opinionated out of the box but get out of the way quickly as requirements start to diverge from the defaults

- Provide a range of non-functional features that are common to large classes of projects (such as embedded servers, security, metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration)

- Absolutely no code generation (when not targeting native image) and no requirement for XML configuration

## Differences with Spring Framework

- Simpler configuration
- Includes a server embebbed
- Desgined for microservices
- Use of starters for managing dependencies
- Simpler monitoring tasks with Actuator
