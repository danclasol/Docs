# Spring Data

Spring Data’s mission is to provide a familiar and consistent, Spring-based programming model for data access while still retaining the special traits of the underlying data store.

## Main modules

### Spring Data Commons

Spring Data Commons is part of the umbrella Spring Data project that provides shared infrastructure across the Spring Data projects.

It contains technology neutral repository interfaces as well as a metadata model for persisting Java classes.

### Spring Data JDBC

Spring Data JDBC, part of the larger Spring Data family, makes it easy to implement JDBC based repositories. This module deals with enhanced support for JDBC based data access layers.

It makes it easier to build Spring powered applications that use data access technologies.

### Spring Data R2DBC

Spring Data R2DBC, part of the larger Spring Data family, makes it easy to implement R2DBC based repositories. R2DBC stands for Reactive Relational Database Connectivity, a specification to integrate SQL databases using reactive drivers.

Spring Data R2DBC applies familiar Spring abstractions and repository support for R2DBC.

It makes it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use relational data access technologies in a reactive application stack.

### Spring Data JPA

Spring Data JPA, part of the larger Spring Data family, makes it easy to easily implement JPA-based (Java Persistence API) repositories. It makes it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use data access technologies.

### Spring Data KeyValue

Map based repositories and SPIs to easily build a Spring Data module for key-value stores.

### Spring Data LDAP

Spring Data for Spring LDAP is part of the umbrella Spring Data project which aims to provide a familiar and consistent Repository abstractions for new Spring LDAP.

### Spring Data MongoDB

Spring Data for MongoDB is part of the umbrella Spring Data providing integration with the MongoDB document database with a wide range of server and driver versions, offering a familiar and consistent Spring based programming model while retaining store specific features and capabilities.

### Spring Data Redis

Spring Data Redis, part of the larger Spring Data portfolio, provides easy configuration and access to Redis from Spring applications. It offers both low-level and high-level abstractions for interacting with the store, freeing users from infrastructural concerns.

### Spring Data REST

Spring Data REST is part of the umbrella Spring Data project and makes it easy to build hypermedia-driven REST web services on top of Spring Data repositories.

Spring Data REST builds on top of Spring Data repositories, analyzes your application’s domain model and exposes hypermedia-driven HTTP resources for aggregates contained in the model.

### Spring Data for Apache Cassandra

Easy configuration and access to Apache Cassandra or large scale, highly available, data oriented Spring applications.

### Spring Data for Apache Geode

Easy configuration and access to Apache Geode for highly consistent, low latency, data oriented Spring applications.

### Spring Data for Elasticserach

Helps integrate Elasticsearch, a distributed search and analytics engine, with Spring applications. It provides an easy way to store and search for data in Elasticsearch.
