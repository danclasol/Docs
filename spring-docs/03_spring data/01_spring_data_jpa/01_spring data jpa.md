# Spring Data JPA

Spring Data JPA provides a higher level of abstraction over JPA (Jakarta Persistence API) and integrates seamlessly with Spring, making it easier and more efficient to interact with relational databases.

- less Boilerplate Code
- powerful query methods

Spring Data JPA leverages JPQL and simplifies its usage by generating queries automatically based on method names and allowing custom queries with @Query.

<dependency>
