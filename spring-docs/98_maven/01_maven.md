# Maven

Maven is a build automation and project management tool used primarily for Java projects.

It helps developers:

- manage dependencies
- build applications
- automate tasks like testing and deployment

## `pom.xml`

Maven uses a configuration file called `pom.xml` (_Project Object Model_) to define:

- Project dependencies (libraries and frameworks)
- Build lifecycle and plugins
- Project metadata (version, name, description, etc.)
