# Maven with Spring boot

Maven is important when working with Spring Boot for several reasons:

### Dependency Management

Spring Boot applications rely on many dependencies, and manually managing them can be complicated.

Maven simplifies this process by handling transitive dependencies automatically.

### Build Automation

Maven provides a structured way to build Spring Boot applications with commands like `mvn clean` install or mvn package.

It ensures consistent builds across different environments.

### Plugin Support

The Spring Boot Maven Plugin (spring-boot-maven-plugin) helps package applications into executable _JARs_ or _WARs_.

It enables running Spring Boot apps directly with `mvn spring-boot:run`.

### Configurating Profiles

Maven allows to configurate easily differents types of profiles (eg.: development profile)

### Integration with CI/CD

Maven integrates well with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and other CI/CD tools for automated testing and deployment.
