# Types

The main benefit of TypeScript is that it enables you to add static types to your JavaScript code.

The TypeScript static compile-time type system closely models the dynamic run-time type system of JavaScript. The static compile-time type system enables you to accurately express the type relationships that are expected to exist when your programs run.

Then, have those assumptions pre-validated by the TypeScript compiler. The TypeScript type analysis occurs entirely at compile-time and adds no run-time overhead to program execution.

# Types in TypeScript

TypeScript inherits the built-in types from JavaScript. TypeScript types are categorized into:

- Primitive types
- Object types
