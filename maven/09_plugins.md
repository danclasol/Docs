# Plugins

In Maven, all work is donde via plugins and goals.

- plugins are collection of goals
- goals perform the actions in Maven builds

Plugins

Plugins extend Maven’s capabilities — they can compile code, run tests, package JARs, deploy to servers, etc.

Common ones:

Plugin Purpose
maven-compiler-plugin Compiles Java source code
maven-surefire-plugin Runs unit tests
maven-jar-plugin Packages the JAR
maven-install-plugin Installs artifact to local repo
maven-deploy-plugin Deploys artifact to remote repo
