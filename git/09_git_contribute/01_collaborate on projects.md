# Collaborating on Projects

Ways to collaborate:

- Fork + PR model: Common in open-source projects
- Shared repo with collaborators:
  - Great for teams
  - The owner can invite others to push directly

Tips for good collaboration:

- Use branches (feature/login, bugfix/button-issue)
- Write clear commit messages
- Comment on PRs for feedback
- Check file _contributing.md_ to owner's advice

Keep your fork up to date with git pull upstream main.

## Websites to contribute

You can find project to contribute in these websites:

## Common Workflow in Open Source

If you don’t have write access to the project (like an open-source repo)

- fork the repo to your own GitHub account
- clone the repository
- create a branch
- make your changes
- push to your fork
- create a pull request from your forked branch → into the original repository's main branch
