# Ignore files

If we want git to ignore file, we need to include the in a file called `.gitignore`

For example, all these files will be ignore by git and will never be uploaded to the repository.

```sh
node_modules # ignore node_modules folder
.env # ignore file with enviroment variables
.DS_Store # ignore SO files
build/ # ignore generated folder
```

## Files

Most common files that are usually included in a `.gitignore`

- Files with credentials or API keys
- Configuration folders of the editor (`/.vscode`)
- Log files
- Files generated by the operating system
- Folders generated with static files like `/dist` or `/build`
- Dependencies directories (`/node_modules`)
- Testing Coverage (`/coverage`)

## Global `.gitignore`

We can create a global `.gitignore` file that will affect to every repository project we create.

However, it recommended to have an specific `.gitignore` in each project because it will be the reference for everyone.

- Create a file called `~/.gitignore_global`

- Update the configuration of `core.excludesfile`, to set a global ignore file for all repositories

  ```sh
  git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
  ```

## Ignore a files that already committed

If we want to start ignoring a file that already has been commited in the repository, we have to:

- Include the file in the `.gitignore`
- Remove the file with the `rm` command
  ```
  git rm config.local.js
  ```
- Commit changes
  ```
  git commit -m "Remove config.local.js to ignore it"
  ```
