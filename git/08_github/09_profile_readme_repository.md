# Profile README Repository

A GitHub Profile README is a special repository that allows users to showcase their skills, projects, and personality directly on their GitHub profile.

To create one, you need to make a new repository with the same name as your GitHub username.

Git will detect that this respository will be your personal profile page

> _is a ✨special ✨ repository that you can use to add a README.md to your GitHub profile. Make sure it’s public and initialize it with a README to get started._

Your profile page on GitHub is a place where people can find out more about you. You can use your profile to:

- Share your interests and skills.
- Showcase your projects and contributions.
- Express your identity and show the GitHub community who you are.
