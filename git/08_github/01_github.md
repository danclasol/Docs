# Github

GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service for source code, built on the version control system Git provides to manage repositories.

It also adds several very useful features for development:

- A very user-friendly interface
- GitHub Actions
- Webhooks
- Dependabot

The use of Git is closely tied to GitHub, which is why many people confuse the two or think they are the same.

- Git is a version control technology and is independent of GitHub
- GitHub is where Git remote repositories are hosted
