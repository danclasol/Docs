# `fetch`

Download changes (commit, branches, tags) from the remote repository without
merging those changes into your current working branch.

Allows to check whatâ€™s new on the remote before you decide to merge or rebase.

```sh
git fetch
```

## Common Uses

Fetch updates from the default remote (usually `origin`)

```sh
git fetch
```

Fetch from a specific remote

```sh
git fetch origin
```

Fetch a specific branch

```sh
git fetch origin main
```

After fetching, you can see the fetched changes by checking the remote branches

```sh
git log origin/main
```

You can also compare changes between your current branch and the fetched remote branch

```sh
git diff main..origin/main
```

## Options

### `--[no-]all`

Fetch all remotes, except for the ones that has the `remote.<name>.skipFetchAll` configuration variable set. This overrides the configuration variable `fetch.all`.

```sh
git fetch --all
```

### `-a` or `--append`

Append ref names and object names of fetched refs to the existing contents of `.git/FETCH_HEAD`. Without this option old data in `.git/FETCH_HEAD` will be overwritten.

```sh
git fetch -a
git fetch --append
```
