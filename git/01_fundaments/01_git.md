# Version control

Version control is a system that manages and tracks changes to files over time, allowing multiple people to collaborate on a project while maintaining a history of all modifications.

Allows to:

- track who and when a file has been changed
- revert to previous versions
- compare differences between versions
- understand the evolution of a project
- multiple developers can work on the same codebase simultaneously
- support branching and merging

# Git

Git is a distributed version control system, free and open-source.

- Licensed under the GPLv2
