# Installing git

Git is usually installed by default on many operating systems, especially those based on Unix.

## Linux

To install Git on Linux using a binary installer, you can generally do so through the basic package management tool provided by your distribution.

If you're using Fedora, for example, you can use `yum`

```
$ yum install git
```

If you're on a Debian-based distribution like Ubuntu, you can use `apt-get`

```
$ apt-get install git
```

## Windows

On Windows, the easiest way is to download the official installer and follow the steps of the setup wizard.
