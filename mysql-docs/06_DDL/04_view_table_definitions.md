## DESCRIBE / SHOW COLUMN

Gives you a summary of a tableâ€™s columns, their types, and constraints.

```sql
DESCRIBE users;
DESC users;
```

## SHOW COLUMNS FROM/IN

Same output as `DESCRIBE`, but can be used in more complex queries or scripts.

```sql
SHOW COLUMNS FROM users;
```

Or

```sql
SHOW COLUMNS IN users;
```
